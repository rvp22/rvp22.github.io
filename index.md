<div class="about me">
<h4><a name="about me"></a>about me</h4>

<p align="justify">
I am a Master's student in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech. My area of interest at VT is Software and Machine Intelligence.
<br><br>
I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from National Institute of Technology - Warangal, India in 2016. After graduation, I worked for one year as an Applications Developer in the Machine Learning and Data Science team at United Health Group, Bangalore. In the past I have done a summer internship in the Computational Intelligence Lab at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore where I worked on clustering algorithms with a focus on image processing.

<h5>Applications Developer, United Health Group</h5>

I worked as an Applications Developer in the Data Science and Machine Learning team. I implemented PoCs on the application of exploratory data analysis and ML models on US health-insurance claims data.
<br><br>
This work lead to the development of models to identify future high-risk patients and to mitigate the risk through prior medical intervention. The models were disease specific and utilized medical and insurance domain knowledge as features used in prediction. 

<br> 

<h5>Research Assistant, Indian Institute of Science</h5>

At IISc, I worked on unsupervised learning algorithms for image segmentation. The focus was on reducing the problems inherent in conventional methodologies such as the failure to overcome undesired locally optimum solutions and sensitivity to cluster centre initialization. 
<br><br>
This work lead to my first publication titled ‘Variance Based Moving K-Means’ in IEEE Advance Computing Conference 2017.

<br>

<h5>Research Assistant, National Institute of Technology, Warangal</h5>

In Summer 2015, I was part of a team that worked on the design of an on-chip Low Dropout Voltage regulator with improved transient response to signal variations. The focus of my work was in chip layout and routing.
