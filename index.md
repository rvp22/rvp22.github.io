<h4><a name="about me"></a>about me</h4>

I am a Master's student in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech. My area of interest at VT is Software and Machine Intelligence.

I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from National Institute of Technology - Warangal, India in 2016. After graduation, I worked for one year as an Applications Developer in the Machine Learning and Data Science team at United Health Group, Bangalore. In the past I have done a summer internship in the Computational Intelligence Lab at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore where I worked on clustering algorithms with a focus on image processing.
